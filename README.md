# 📉 Customer Churn Predictor
A Machine Learning–based Customer Churn Prediction system that estimates the probability of a customer leaving a telecom service provider. The project implements a full end-to-end classification workflow including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training with imbalanced data handling, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit web application.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict customer churn probability based on demographic, service, and billing information
- End-to-end ML pipelines combining preprocessing, SMOTE, and classification
- Model comparison using cross-validated ROC-AUC
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Single production-ready pipeline saved as a `.pkl` file
- Interactive Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data Preprocessing & EDA
    - Removed irrelevant identifier columns
    - Cleaned numerical inconsistencies in TotalCharges
    - Performed exploratory data analysis:
        - Churn distribution
        - Tenure vs Churn
        - Monthly Charges vs Churn
    - Saved cleaned dataset for downstream modeling

- Feature Engineering
    - Encoded target variable: 
        - Churn: Yes → 1, No → 0
    - Standardized service-related categorical labels:
        - Replaced "No phone service" and "No internet service" with "No"
    - Performed stratified train–test split (80/20)
    - Saved raw train–test splits for reproducibility

- Model Training & Evaluation
    - Built full machine learning pipelines using `imblearn.Pipeline`:
        - Preprocessing with ColumnTransformer
        - Feature scaling for numerical variables
        - One-hot encoding for categorical features
        - SMOTE for class imbalance handling
        - Classification model
    - Trained and compared multiple classifiers:
        - Logistic Regression (best performing)
        - Random Forest
        - Gradient Boosting
        - Support Vector Machine
    - Evaluated models using:
        - 5-fold cross-validated ROC-AUC (mean & standard deviation)
        - Precision, Recall, and F1-score on the test set
        - Selected the best baseline model based on ROC-AUC
        - Saved artifact: `base_pipeline.pkl`

- Hyperparameter Tuning
    - Tuned Logistic Regression using `GridSearchCV`
    - Used ROC-AUC as the optimization metric
    - Evaluated tuned model on test data
    - Saved final optimized pipeline

- Deployment
    - Built an interactive Streamlit web application
    - User inputs customer details through structured UI sections
    - Outputs churn probability with risk interpretation
    - Includes basic input validation for billing consistency
